# simple-debug.css

Debug your layouts with one line of CSS



## How to use

There are a few ways you can run simple-debug.css.

1. Include `simple-debug.css` just before the `</head>` closing tag.

```html
    â€¦
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="simple-debug.css">
</head>
```

2. Drag this link to your bookmarks bar and use it as a bookmarklet: [simple-debug.css](javascript:(function(){var newcss='*{outline:1px solid #fff!important;background-color:rgba(0,2,54,.1)!important}';if('\v'=='v'){document.createStyleSheet().cssText=newcss;}else{var tag=document.createElement('style');tag.type='text/css';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(tag);tag[(typeof document.body.style.WebkitAppearance=='string')?'innerText':'innerHTML']= newcss;}})();)

3. Paste in this single line of code at the bottom of your site's last CSS file.

```css
*{outline:1px solid #fff!important;background-color:rgba(0,2,54,.1)!important}
```
